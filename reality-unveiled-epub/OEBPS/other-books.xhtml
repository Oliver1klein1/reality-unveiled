                    <div class="book-text">
                        <p><strong>You've been worshiping the wrong God!</strong></p>
                        <p>Jesus exposed Him. Paul enshrined Him.</p>
                        <p><strong>Yahweh is not the Father!</strong></p>
                        <p>This book is a wrecking ball.</p>
                        <p>With scripture as evidence, it unmasks Yahweh's commands — genocide, slavery, child sacrifice — and the shocking truth that Paul, not Jesus, built Christianity.</p>
                        <p>Our Father's identity has been distorted. As has ours. We'd been neutralized. Mission-accomplished. Potential-stifled.</p>
                        <p>This book splits the cracks wide open: no blood sacrifice required, no "original sin," no counterfeit god. Only the Father Jesus revealed … pure love without terms and conditions. United with us.</p>
                        <p><strong>Raw. Explosive. Liberating.</strong></p>

                    <div class="book-text">
                        <p><strong>The Jesus you know is a fabrication.</strong></p>
                        <p>Not the man himself—but the story we've been told about him.</p>
                        <p>For centuries, the church has systematically reframed Jesus' radical message, turning a revolutionary teacher of love and liberation into a religious figurehead who supports the very systems he came to dismantle.</p>
                        <p>This book peels back the layers of theological manipulation to reveal the authentic Jesus—the one who challenged religious authority, championed the marginalized, and taught that the kingdom of God is within you, not in a distant heaven.</p>
                        <p><strong>Discover the Jesus the church doesn't want you to know.</strong></p>

                    <div class="book-text">
                        <p>What if the Bible's contradictions are clues — not merely errors?</p>
                        <p><strong>101 Illustrated Bible Contradictions</strong> exposes the hidden seams — verses that clash, timelines that twist, doctrines that collide.</p>
                        <p>But beneath the chaos lies some deeper truths.</p>
                        <p>These cracks reveal two competing images of God: the wrathful Yahweh of Moses versus the loving Father Jesus revealed. And a divided faith — torn between Jesus' Kingdom of Love and Paul's empire-friendly gospel.</p>
                        <p>In this eye-opening guide, 12 Keys unlock what the contradictions show us — how Scripture was shaped, edited, and weaponized… and how the Truth still shines through. See the flaws. Find the freedom. Rediscover the Father.</p>

                    <div class="book-text">
                        <p>What if the story of eternal torment isn't from Jesus at all?</p>
                        <p>In <strong>Escape the Hell Myth</strong>, Ansilo Boff exposes the shocking truth: the doctrine of everlasting punishment was built on mistranslations, theological bias, and fear-based control—not on the words of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Through deep linguistic study and bold spiritual insight, this book unpacks what Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and aionios really meant in the original texts, how Jesus' teachings reveal a God of restoration, not retribution, why Yahweh's violent commands contradict the loving Father Jesus revealed, and the breathtaking hope of universal reconciliation—a divine plan to heal all creation.</p>
                        <p>If you've ever questioned how a loving God could condemn souls to eternal fire, this book will help you escape the lie and rediscover the liberating message of Jesus. <strong>Jesus never taught Hell. He revealed a Father who restores, not destroys.</strong></p>

                    <p>In <em>The Father's Heart Series</em>, Ansilo Boff re-introduces children to the gentle, forgiving Father that Jesus revealed — not a God of punishment or fear, but one of peace, mercy, and inclusion.</p>
                    <p>Through tender storytelling and luminous watercolor illustrations, each book turns everyday moments into spiritual discoveries: forgiving a friend, using kind words, feeling peace during storms, sharing what we have, and welcoming others at our table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Every page helps children (and parents) unlearn fear and rediscover love.</strong></p>
                    <p>Because when we see others — and God — through Jesus' eyes, the world becomes a brighter, kinder place.</p>

                        <p>A tender, hope-filled story that helps children let go of anger, make peace quickly, and feel God's smile again.</p>

                        <p><strong>Before your daughter sees your face, she already carries your heartbeat within her.</strong></p>
                        <p>This book is your soul, written in lullabies.</p>
                        <p>Through tender five-line poems and radiant illustrations, a mother weaves lessons of kindness, courage, and freedom.</p>
                        <p>A gift every mum-to-be will cherish—a promise of love wrapped in poetry.</p>
