        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Akashic Records</div>
            <div class="term-definition">A non-physical repository of all knowledge, events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. Sometimes described as a cosmic library or universal consciousness field that can be accessed through deep meditation, prayer, or altered states of consciousness.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Altered States of Consciousness</div>
            <div class="term-definition">Conditions of awareness that differ significantly from ordinary waking consciousness, including meditation, prayer, trance, mystical experiences, and near-death experiences. Jesus often accessed these states during his times of solitary prayer and connection with the Father.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="letter-heading">B</div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Biocentrism</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The theory that life and consciousness are fundamental to the universe—not the other way around. It suggests that space and time aren't objects or things but rather tools our mind uses to process information. This aligns with Jesus' teachings that the Kingdom of Heaven exists within us.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="letter-heading">C</div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Christ Consciousness</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The highest state of intellectual development and emotional maturity, characterized by unconditional love and profound wisdom. Jesus demonstrated this state perfectly, and his teachings suggest that this divine awareness is accessible to everyone ("You are gods").</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Collective Consciousness</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The shared beliefs, attitudes, and moral judgments that operate as a unifying force within society. In a deeper sense, it refers to the interconnected awareness that links all living beings. Jesus referred to this unity when he prayed "that they may be one as we are one" (John 17:22).</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Consciousness</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The state of being aware; the subjective experience of existing. Rather than a product of the brain, consciousness may be fundamental to reality itself. Jesus taught that consciousness (awareness) determines our reality: "According to your faith let it be done to you" (Matthew 9:29).</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="letter-heading">D</div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Divine Nature</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The fundamental spiritual essence of human beings, representing our connection to and participation in divine consciousness. Jesus taught that we share in this divine nature when he said "You are gods" (John 10:34), revealing our inherent spiritual power and potential.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">

        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Ego</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The aspect of consciousness that identifies with the personality, body, thoughts, and individual story. The ego creates the illusion of separation and operates from fear and control. Jesus taught transcending ego identification to recognize one's true divine nature.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Entanglement</div>

        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Higher Self</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The eternal, more enlightened part of you that exists beyond ego-consciousness. It represents your divine nature, true essence, and connection to the universal consciousness. Jesus referred to this when saying "The Father and I are one" and suggesting we could access the same unity consciousness.</div>

            <div class="term-name">I AM Consciousness</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The state of pure awareness of being, beyond identification with thought, emotion, or form. When Jesus declared "Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58), he was identifying with this eternal consciousness rather than his temporary human form.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="letter-heading">K</div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Kingdom of Heaven/God</div>
            <div class="term-definition">Not a physical location or afterlife destination, but a state of consciousness characterized by peace, love, and direct connection with divine reality. Jesus emphasized that this kingdom is "within you" and "at hand"—accessible in the present moment through transformed awareness.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="letter-heading">L</div>

            <div class="term-definition">A profound personal experience associated with death or impending death, often including feelings of peace, out-of-body sensations, life review, and encounters with light beings. These experiences suggest consciousness continues beyond physical death, confirming Jesus' teachings about eternal life.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Non-Duality</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The philosophical concept that there is no fundamental separation between self and other, subject and object, or human and divine.

            <div class="term-name">Quantum Field</div>
            <div class="term-definition">The underlying energy field of potential from which all physical reality emerges. This field responds to consciousness and intention, similar to how Jesus described faith as being able to move mountains and manifest healing.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="term">
            <div class="term-name">Quantum Healing</div>
            <div class="term-definition">Healing that occurs at the quantum (subatomic) level, where consciousness can directly influence physical reality.
